## About Me

Hi! My name is Jason and I am a graduate student pursuing a PhD in Statistics. I currently am attending [MSU Denver](https://www.msudenver.edu) while I complete the pre-requisites for the PhD Statistics program offered by [Colorado State University](https://statistics.colostate.edu/). I also work as a data analyst using `R` alongside creating cool projects that explore data and various programming concepts.
