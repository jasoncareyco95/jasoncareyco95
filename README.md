## About Me

Hi! My name is Jason and I am a graduate student pursuing a PhD in Statistics. I currently am attending [MSU Denver](https://www.msudenver.edu) while I complete the pre-requisites for the PhD Statistics program offered at [Colorado State University](https://statistics.colostate.edu/). I also work as an associate data scientist using `R` to create automated workflows, custom visualizations, reports, dashboards, and packages that explore data and various programming concepts.
