## About Me

Hi! My name is Jason and I am a student pursuing a PhD in Computer Science concentrating in Artificial Intelligence research with application in interdisciplinary fields. I currently hold two undergraduate degrees, a Bachelors of Science in Accounting & Finance and a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics, both awarded by [MSU Denver](https://www.msudenver.edu). In my professional career, I serve as a data scientist for CliftonLarsonAllen ([CLA](https://www.claconnect.com/en)) using R, Python, and SQL to create automated machine learning pipelines, create custom reports and dashboards reporting KPIs to key stakeholders, maintain large database schemas, and develop proprietery packages/libraries that analyze internal and external data.

## Projects

Interdisciplinary projects that I've had the opportunity to work on are:
