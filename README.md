## About Me

Hi! My name is Jason and I am a graduate student pursuing a PhD in Statistics. I'm currently attending [MSU Denver](https://www.msudenver.edu) while I complete the pre-requisites required for multiple applied statistics graduate programs I anticipate applying to during the end of 2022. I also work as an associate data scientist using `R` and `Python` to create automated workflows, custom visualizations, reports, dashboards, and packages that explore data and various programming concepts.

## Areas of Study

The concepts/topics I'm studying to continually develop my R skills are (in order of priority):
