## About Me

Hi! My name is Jason and I am a Senior Data Scientist employed by [CliftonLarsonAllen](https://www.claconnect.com/en) (CLA). In my day-to-day operations I use R, Python, and SQL to create automated machine learning and generative AI pipelines that solve firmwide problems or introduce impactful solutions for our clients. I have a background in Accounting & Finance as well as Applied Mathematics with a specialization in quantitative computing. I've also contributed to research within the renewable energy technology field of study through interdisiplinary collaboration. I'm passionate about renewable energy technologies and how they will shape our future and our world. My goal is to apply my knowledge and my skills in applied mathematics and computer science to solve some of the biggest problems our generations face due to climate change.
